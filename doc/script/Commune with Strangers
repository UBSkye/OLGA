"They couldn't speak, so they showed me instead..."
	(The Strangers grab hold of Olga, dragging her into the darkness)
	(Olga opens her eyes; her hair shines even in this horrid darkness, and the light shows her their message)
	(Many images of the Gods and their Planes float by)
"Visions of the cosmos, of worlds far beyond mine, the scale and depth of the infinite universe."
	(The Strangers devouring a Plane whole, and its components becoming one with the Void, then remade into another world)
"They were drones, tasked with the culling of creation, devouring and converting all into the aether known as Void."
	(With the Deep Voice gone, the masses scatter and cannot consume worlds with such meager numbers)
"But Obed, the Deep Voice guiding their hands, has gone silent, and now the masses have become scattered and unformed."
	(image of daniel's resting place)
"And soon, if unchecked, the "final end" will be upon us..."
	(distorted cry)
"My task was clear: to wake Obed, I must gather the masses. Form a call even the Domain of Void cannot ignore."
	(Cut back to Olga; the Strangers release her, then she pulls her hands loose)
	(She looks down; her hands are now covered in thin black lines stretching out like thorns)
"And they just granted me a way to help call to their kin."
	(Olga looks up at the Stranger; they smile and nod at her, then disappear into the darkness)
