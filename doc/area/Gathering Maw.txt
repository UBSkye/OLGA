=== THE GATHERING MAW ===
The central HUB of Olga's quest, where all souls that fall into the Void wake. Though the outer ring 
is as disturbing as one would expect, the inner sanctum has become a small settlement of trapped and
cowardly souls that have refused the Void's calls.

Here the player is introduced to several characters as well as the Void's currency: Flint, slang for
shattered fragments of memories and thoughts. In the Void, amassing memories and thoughts is key
to retaining one's self, and souls lust to horde such lost and masterless knowledge above all else.

Matterfolk comprise most of the town, with the sole exception being the odd Voidfolk known as
Honeybee that had settled into the area long before any of its current residents arrived.


=== PIT OF FADE ===
Beneath the town lies the pit known as Fade, where the residents toss the souls that lose themselves
but don't become outwardly hostile. Whenever a Matterfolk 'dies' in the Void they wake floating in
the misty pool in the pit's center. Fadefolk are never hostile here, but rarely have anything of
much value to say.


=== POOLS OF AETHER ===
Past the outer circle of the Maw lies a massive cavern, with the Maw itself being situated within a
small circular opening beneath the blackened sky above. Scattered throughout the cavern are pools
filled with a cloudy substance that restores a soul's stability.
