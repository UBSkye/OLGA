The Fields of Vo
	"A mass of ruined buildings, Fadefolk and, naturally, predatory Taintfolk. Many in the Maw refer to these
	 Fields as the gathering point for all that is not sentient, as ruins of vastly different materials and
	 cultural origins lie piled upon each other. Even the ground seems eerily mixed of countless types of
	 plantlife rather than the cold stone-like darkness of the rest of the Void."
	
	* A means of finding new areas; the Fields connect to numerous areas, though many require different
	  abilities and skill levels to access
	* Any area connected to the Fields of Vo is connected to its neighbors anyway; the Fields rarely must be
	  entered at all, if avoided
