"Beware the children whom gaze brazenly upon the pale star aloft our Realm, for they are set upon a Void-borne fate."

Olga is an apprentice magician who fell to the Void while asleep one night, and sets out to fulfill an unknown fate.
Her title refers to her hair- the shining gold color is unique in her homeland, and it shines and brightens even the Void.
